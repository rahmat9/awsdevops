This is my git learning notes.Which i believe its useful for reference in job search n updating skills.

1. Log into github.com and create a account.

2. Download gitbash on windows

Note: Git is like a software and github is like a provider.

Note: Follow the 1 n 2 steps for creating a bitbucket account.

3. In gitbash --->    git config --global user.name "*****"
                      git config --global user.email "****"

		      git clone "githubrepolink#https
4. After cloning --> go to the directory/Repository

   Then, create a files/programs as per requirement.

5. Follow , git commands 1. git add -A ; git commit -m "INC123" ; git push origin master

6. git pull  , which is useful ..it gets latest updated code. 

7. git branch is a command which we can see, what are the available branches.

8. We need to observe the pointer to identify the branch.

9. To merge the branch, we need to go master branch and the use git merge branchname

10. we can use git branch -d branchname eg: git branch - tst.

11. to discard the changes, git branch -D branchname
